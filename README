Tired of not having a good to-do application for
iPhone, I decided to start my own one and of course in
Free Software.

This will be my first application in x-code and the first for iPhone.
I hope to do my best and learn on the road.

Feel free to work on what you want and all aid
be grateful, and you are all welcome.

If you like it or want to contribute something, go ahead :)

Greetings!
